# Flax & Poppy

<!-- preface -->
This bread has a wonderful mix of cracker-like crunch from the flax and a mild poppy flavor.
The extended contact the flax meal has with the dough produces a more tender crumb while seeds that escaped pulverization add some crunch to the texture. The seed ratio is key here and could easily be increased for more pronounced character.

### Process

(HAND MIX)

Basic process for sourdough boules.
Long autolyse with a couple stretch & folds before introducing the levain, then stretched and folded two more times before adding the seed mix and folding another two times.

<!-- timetable -->
### Timetable
Day 1: Combine ingredients, 4x stretch & folds, bulk ferment until nearly doubled, cover and leave overnight in the fridge.

Day 2: Remove dough from the fridge and get it to room temperature (2 - 4 hours). Shape and place in floured bannetons and wait for dough to rise nearly to the top (3 - 4 hours). Turn dough out onto parchment, scored and place into a preheated covered dutch oven. Bake at 450ºF for 35 min., then 8 - 10 min. uncovered.

<!-- notes -->
### Notes
No perceived sour.
Flax added an additional crisp to the crust.

Could push hydration to 80 - 85% considering the flax meal.
