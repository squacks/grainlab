# Flax & Poppy

<!-- preface -->
This bread has a wonderful mix of cracker-like crunch from the flax and a mild
poppy flavor.

The extended contact the flax meal has with the dough produces a more tender
crumb while seeds that escaped pulverization add some crunch to the texture.
The seed ratio is key here and could easily be increased for more pronounced
character.

### Process

(HAND MIX)

Basic process for sourdough boules.
Long autolyse with a couple stretch & folds before introducing the levain, then
stretched and folded two more times before adding the seed mix and folding
another two times.

<!-- timetable -->
### Timetable
Day 1: Combine ingredients, 4x stretch & folds, bulk ferment until nearly
doubled, cover and leave overnight in the fridge.

Day 2: Remove dough from the fridge and get it to room temperature (2 - 4
hours). Shape and place in floured bannetons and wait for dough to rise nearly
to the top (3 - 4 hours). Turn dough out onto parchment, scored and place into
a preheated covered dutch oven. Bake at 450ÂºF for 35 min., then 8 - 10 min.
uncovered.

<!-- notes -->
### Notes
No perceived sour.
Flax added an additional crisp to the crust.

Could push hydration to 80 - 85% considering the flax meal.
