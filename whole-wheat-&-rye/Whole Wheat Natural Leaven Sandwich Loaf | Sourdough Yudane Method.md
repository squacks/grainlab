### Process

(HAND MIX)

Mix boiling water with bread flour and let cool to room temperature or under ~80ºF.
Combine Yudane with the rest of the flour, wet ingredients (minus the salt), and leaven. Let rest for 30 minutes. Proceed to knead for 10 minutes.
Stretch the dough out and sprinkle salt over top. Proceed to stretch and fold to incorporate the salt. Optionally, do a couple stretch and folds until there is visible yeast activity/rise in the dough.


<!-- timetable -->
### Timetable
Day 1: Combine ingredients the evening before. Knead 10 min. until elastic, 2x stretch & folds, ferment until visible yeast activity, place in container and refrigerate for a cold bulk fermentation.

Day 2: Remove dough from fridge to acclimate to room temperature, ~2 hours. Divide into 5 equal pieces, roll, shape, and place into an oiled loaf pan. Cover with plastic wrap. Final proof 1.5 - 2 hours until dough rises past the pan edge by about half an inch. Brush with egg wash (if desired) and bake at 400ºF for 40 minutes.

<!-- notes -->
### Notes
Shooting for 66% hydration factoring in the starter weight of water and flour (50/50). Dough is extremely sticky during the hand kneading process from the gelatinized starch in the Yudane - don't give up and add more flour, just keep going.
